The goal of this assignment is to develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to predict temperature based on historical weather data. The focus was on applying advanced time-series analysis techniques and implementing key components of RNNs from scratch.

# Key Highlights
Custom RNN Implementation:

Designed and implemented an RNN from scratch.
Included manual computations for the forward and backward passes.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted time-related features (e.g., hour of the day) to enhance the model's ability to recognize patterns.
Applied transformations for cyclic features (e.g., sine and cosine transformations for time-related periodicity).
Sequential Data Handling:

Utilized time-series analysis techniques to preprocess and model sequential data effectively.
# Tools and Libraries
Python: Core programming language used for the implementation.
NumPy: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for benchmarking and testing against pre-built RNN models.
